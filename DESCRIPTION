Description: Full name of the package should be vigilante & knights (Visualizing Integrated Genomics in Linked and Nested Translational Elaboration & Knowing Numbers in Genomic Hypothesis Through Statistics). The goal of vigilante is to facilitate data analysis and visualization in high-throughput next-generation sequencing (HT-NGS) researches by empowering researchers to perform complex, cutting-edge informatics-based analyses on their whole genome/exosome sequencing (WGS/WES) and RNA-seq data in an interactive open-source environment with statistical modules built to assess biological events. Also, vigilante works in a highly self-contained pipeline style, and is designed to be user-friendly even for non-informatics researchers who don't have much experience in programming.
