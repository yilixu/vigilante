##### Visualizing Integrated Genomics in Linked and Nested Translational Elaboration & Knowing Numbers in Genomic Hypothesis Through Statistics

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->
The goal of ***vigilante & knights*** is to facilitate data analysis and visualization in high-throughput next-generation sequencing (HT-NGS) researches by empowering researchers to perform complex, cutting-edge informatics-based analyses on their whole genome/exosome sequencing (WGS/WES) and RNA-seq data in an interactive open-source environment with statistical modules built to assess biological events. Also, ***vigilante & knights*** works in a highly self-contained pipeline style, and is designed to be user-friendly even for non-informatics researchers who don't have much experience in programming.

Installation
------------

Currently ***vigilante & knights*** is under reconfiguration for the official R package release, and the development version (phased release) of ***vigilante & knights*** can be installed from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("yilixu/vigilante", ref = "main")
```
