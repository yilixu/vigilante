Description: Full name of the package should be vigilante & knights (Visualizing Integrated Genomics In Linked And Nested Translational Elaboration & Knowing Numbers In Genomic Hypothesis Through Statistics). The goal of vigilante is to facilitate data analysis and visualization with next-generation sequencing (NGS) researches. Also, vigilante works in a highly self-contained pipeline style, and is designed to be user-friendly even for researchers who don't have much experience in programming.
